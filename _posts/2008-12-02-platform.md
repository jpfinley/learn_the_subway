# What to do on the platform

There are two configurations of rail platforms: one-track and two-track. With the one track platforms, all trains arrive in the same fashion and they are easier to navigate. With the two-track platforms, be sure to use the overhead signs to orient yourself once below-ground. They work like this:

- **Direction of travel.** In a general sense, this is where you are headed.
- **Explanations for the lines that run on this track.** Look here to determine which lines stop at this platform, and when. Try your best to work through some odd abbreviations and mine breaks.
- **Exceptions.** Some trains don't run at all hours or every day. Your options may be explained here.

If you see a service advisory sign, it's important to take note. Service can be unpredictable (especially on weekends and late nights), so following the directions is important to getting home safely.

Be sure to read the train route number or letter before you get on any train. There is nothing worse than having the doors close behind you only to realize that you are on an express train going to the wrong direction.
