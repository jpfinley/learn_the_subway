# The Subway Map

The first step to getting where you want to go is knowing where you want to go. That's where the map of the subway system will come in.

There are a few things to keep in mind when using the map. We'll go through those in more detail here.

## Definitely not to scale

The map is stretched, compressed, and skewed to show all of New York—including  all subway lines, landmarks, and major streets—on one page. Compare the subway map to a proper projected map and marvel at the difference!

## Train Lines

Each line of track is designated by a color, and that track might carry more than one line. Let's try an example.

Find the A-C-E line. It's color is blue, and it more or less runs down from the top of Manhattan, with parts going through horizontally across Queens and Brooklyn. Got it? Take a look at how the line is labeled at different places. Since there are three lines traveling along this track, it might be labeled A-C-E, A-C, or just E depending on where the lines split up.

## Station Identification

Now that we've found a few subway lines, let's get more specific and talk about stations. Stations appear on the map as circles on a subway track. Black circles denote stations that only have local service, and white ones for stations where both local and express trains stop.

Stations also are accompanied by a text label that provides some handy info. For example find the 34th Street Penn Station stop on our favorite line, the A-C-E. (*Hint: It's a bit below Central Park in Manhattan.*) Looking at the label, we can see the station name, of course. But listed along side are icons telling us that this station is accessible for people with disabilities and can take you to the airport via a certain train. Below the station name we see which trains on this track stop here. In the case of 34th Street, all three (A, C, and E) stop here in addition to hooking up with the Long Island Railroad. If we went a stop further downtown, we see that only the C and E lines stop at 23rd Street.

If you see a line drawn between two stations, that means you can transfer from one line to the other at that station. Nearly every transfer is free. More about transfers later on.

There's a lot more to cover here, but you don't need to know absolutely everything at this point. Feel free to pour over the map some more to get familiar with the subway's layout. You would be wise to check the map's key for more details.
