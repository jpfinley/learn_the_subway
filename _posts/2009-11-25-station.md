# Anatomy of a Subway Station

Once you've gone down the stairs into the subway station itself, your first goal is likely to buy your fare. The tokens you may remember have been phased out in favor of the MetroCard (an odd name, since exactly zero New Yorkers refer to the subway as "The Metro"), a plastic card that is magnetically encoded with your fare.

MetroCards can be purchased  from the station's booth (provided someone is behind the glass), but attendants are so hard to hear that you are better off buying your MetroCard from one of the vending machines in the station.

## MetroCards

MetroCard vending machines look a lot like ATMs, and can provide you your fare with payment of cash, credit, or debit. The fare these days is $2.25, which lets you ride the subway as long as you like until you exit. There are discounts available to you if you buy a MetroCard of certain value, but the discounts are too confusing to enumerate. Unlimited ride MetroCards are also available which let you ride all you want for a certain time for a fixed price.

## The Art of The Turnstile

To enter the turnstile, swipe your MetroCard through the card reader and walk on through. This seems easy enough at first, but you can avoid walking full-speed into a locked turnstile by following these pro tips:
- *Be mindful of orientation* The card only works when it faces a certain direction, so get familiar with how it looks and feels in your hand.
- *Feel it out* Swipe too fast and it won't work. Swipe too slow and it won't work. The right speed is somewhat close to walking speed; with proper timing and enough courage, you should be able to swipe and walk without even slowing down.
- *Get some feedback* If you have a bad swipe, the turnstile will give you a different sound and appropriate visual indication. Learn to tell the difference before you walk into an immobile turnstile.

After a successful swipe, walk right on through the turnstile and you'll arrive at the station platform.
