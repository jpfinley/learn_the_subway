# Getting around in New York City

When it comes to actually moving yourself from here to there, New Yorkers tend to choose between walking, taking a taxi, and using public transportation. Shockingly few residents own a car, but with the city as compact and congested as it is, driving yourself is more trouble than it's worth.

Taxis are pretty easy to find in most parts of the city. But the costs of using a taxi to get everywhere add up quickly. Buses, too, are plentiful. However, many people find that the New York City subway provides the best compromise of cost, speed, and availability.

In general, trains run every 2 to 5 minutes during rush hours (6:30 - 9:30 a.m., and 3:30 - 8 p.m., Monday through Friday), every 5 to 10 minutes during the midday (9:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday), every 5 to 15 minutes in the evening (8 p.m. - midnight), and about every 20 minutes between midnight and 6:30 a.m.

During non-rush hours, many trains have fewer cars. Look for black and yellow signs telling you where to wait on the platform.
