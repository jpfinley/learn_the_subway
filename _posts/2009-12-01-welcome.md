# The Layout of the City

New York is certainly a big place. With more than 8.3 million people, it is the largest city in the United States! But that doesn't mean it is impossible to get from one side to the other. In fact, New York City has a public transit system that can take you nearly anywhere you want to go.

## The New York Landscape

But before we get down to the trains, perhaps it's best to start with the city as a whole.

The entire city of New York is represented here, split up into five sections, or boroughs. Those are:

- **1** The Bronx
- **2** Manhattan
- **3** Queens
- **4** Brooklyn
- **5** Staten Island

Each borough has its own unique character (and its own characters). All of them, however, have subway lines that will help you get around.

## Some Words on Orientation

You will often hear people describing a place as "uptown" or "downtown". This is in reference to places relative to each other in Manhattan. Uptown is the direction heading northeast, and downtown is the direction heading to the financial district. Keep in mind Manhattan is mostly laid out in a grid, but a grid oriented more northeast than north.
